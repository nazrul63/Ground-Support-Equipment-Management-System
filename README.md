# Ground Support Equipment Management System

Designed and developed a Ground Support Equipment Management System along with an interactive dashboard and reporting tool to facilitate monitoring of ground equipment usage, management and serviceability. The system enabled real-time monitoring of key performance metrics, leading to data-driven decision-making and increased efficiency by 40% by reducing manual labour to 80%. This system replaced the previous manual process, resulting in a digital transformation of the Ground Support Equipment Management.
